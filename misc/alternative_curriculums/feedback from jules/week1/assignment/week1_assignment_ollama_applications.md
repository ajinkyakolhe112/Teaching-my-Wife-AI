# Assignment 1: Exploring Ollama Model Capabilities

**Objective:** To encourage users to think about practical applications of local LLMs and to deepen their experimentation with different models and prompting.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Completion of Lab 1: Getting Started with Ollama (or equivalent experience).
*   At least two different LLMs downloaded via Ollama (e.g., `phi3:mini`, `llama3:8b`, `codellama:7b`).

## Tasks:

### 1. Model Comparison (Creative Task)

*   **Objective:** To observe how different models handle a creative text generation task.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Choose **two different models** you have downloaded (e.g., `phi3:mini` and `llama3:8b`).
    2.  Craft a single creative prompt. For example:
        *   `"Write a very short story, in 5 sentences, about a robot who discovers a garden."`
        *   `"Compose a short poem (4-6 lines) about the city at night."`
        *   `"Describe a fantastical creature that lives in the clouds."`
        (Feel free to create your own unique prompt!)
    3.  Using `ollama run <model_name>`, give this exact same prompt to each of your chosen models.
    4.  Record the full output from each model.

*   **Submission Content for this Task:**
    *   The exact prompt you used.
    *   The full, unedited response from Model 1.
    *   The full, unedited response from Model 2.
    *   A brief discussion (1-2 paragraphs) comparing the outputs. Consider:
        *   Differences in writing style, tone, or vocabulary.
        *   Coherence and how well each model stuck to the prompt's constraints (e.g., sentence limit).
        *   Perceived creativity or originality.
        *   Any noticeable strengths or weaknesses of each model for this type of task.

### 2. Model Comparison (Coding Task)

*   **Objective:** To compare the code generation capabilities of a general-purpose model versus a code-specific model.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Choose **one general-purpose model** (e.g., `llama3:8b`, `phi3:mini`) and **one code-specific model** (e.g., `codellama:7b`).
    2.  Craft a single, simple coding prompt. For example:
        *   `"Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of those numbers."`
        *   `"Generate a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed."`
        *   `"Write a bash script that counts the number of files in the current directory."`
        (You can choose a different simple coding task in a language you are familiar with.)
    3.  Using `ollama run <model_name>`, give this exact same prompt to each of your chosen models.
    4.  Record the code generated by each model.

*   **Submission Content for this Task:**
    *   The exact prompt you used.
    *   The full code snippet generated by the general-purpose model.
    *   The full code snippet generated by the code-specific model.
    *   Indicate whether you tested the generated code and if it ran correctly (no need for extensive debugging, just a quick check).
    *   A brief discussion (1-2 paragraphs) comparing the outputs. Consider:
        *   Correctness and completeness of the code.
        *   Adherence to good coding practices (if applicable for a simple snippet).
        *   Any differences in how the models approached the problem.
        *   Which model seemed more effective for this task and why.

### 3. Practical Application Idea

*   **Objective:** To brainstorm potential uses for local LLMs.
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  Think about a simple, practical application where a local LLM running via Ollama could be useful in your daily life, studies, or work.
        *   Examples: A command-line tool to summarize selected text, a simple Q&A bot for your personal notes, a generator for boilerplate code snippets you often use, a tool to rephrase sentences, etc.
    2.  Describe your application idea.
    3.  Explain which model(s) available through Ollama (that you know of or have used) might be suitable for this application and why. Consider factors like model size, capabilities (text, code), and speed.

*   **Submission Content for this Task:**
    *   **Application Description (1 paragraph):** Clearly describe what your application would do and who might use it.
    *   **Model Suitability (1 paragraph):** Explain your choice of model(s) for this application, linking their characteristics to the application's needs.

## Submission Guidelines:

*   Compile your responses for all three tasks into a single document.
*   You can use Markdown (preferred, save as a `.md` file) or create a PDF.
*   Ensure you include the exact prompts you used and the full, unedited LLM outputs where requested for Tasks 1 and 2.
*   Name your file clearly, e.g., `week1_assignment_yourname.md`.

This assignment aims to help you explore the diverse capabilities and nuances of different LLMs. There are often no single "right" answers, especially in the creative task. Focus on careful observation and clear articulation of your findings. Good luck!
