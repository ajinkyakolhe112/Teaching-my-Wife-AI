2. **Plot:** Mr. Darcy's first proposal to Elizabeth Bennet is initially met with fierce rejection. Analyze this pivotal scene, explaining why Elizabeth reacts as she does, and how Darcy's subsequent letter acts as a crucial turning point not just for their relationship, but for Elizabeth's self-perception.
3. **Themes:** Marriage is a central preoccupation in *Pride and Prejudice*, presented through various pairings (e.g., Jane and Bingley, Lydia and Wickham, Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins). Discuss how Austen uses these diverse unions to explore contrasting societal motivations for marriage in the Regency era, and what message she ultimately conveys about an ideal union.
