# Comprehensive Workshop Summary: "0 to LLM" - Complete 12-Lecture Curriculum

## Workshop Overview

This is a comprehensive 12-lecture workshop designed to take students from zero knowledge to building custom LLM applications. The workshop uses a **human development analogy** as a core mental model throughout the curriculum, making complex AI concepts accessible through familiar human learning processes.

**Core Mental Model: Human Development Analogy**
The workshop is built around three fundamental AI training methods explained through human development:
1. **Pre-training**: Raising a child (Birth to Age 21) - Massive time investment, very high cost
2. **RAG**: Graduate with Library Access - Medium time investment, moderate cost, always needs library access  
3. **Fine-tuning**: Graduate Course - Short time investment (2 years), lower cost, learns information so well it doesn't need to look it up
