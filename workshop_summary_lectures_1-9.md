# Workshop Summary: Lectures 1-12 - "0 to LLM" Workshop

## Workshop Overview
This is a comprehensive 12-lecture workshop designed to take students from zero knowledge to building custom LLM applications. The workshop uses a human development analogy as a core mental model throughout the curriculum.

## Core Mental Model: Human Development Analogy
The workshop is built around three fundamental AI training methods explained through human development:
1. **Pre-training**: Raising a child (Birth to Age 21) - Massive time investment, very high cost
2. **RAG**: Graduate with Library Access - Medium time investment, moderate cost, always needs library access
3. **Fine-tuning**: Graduate Course - Short time investment (2 years), lower cost, learns information so well it doesn't need to look it up

## Current State for Lecture 10
Students have now:
- ✅ Understood what LLMs are and how to interact with them
- ✅ Built and trained models from scratch
- ✅ Used pre-trained models for various tasks
- ✅ Fine-tuned models for specific domains
- ✅ Created instruction-following models
- ✅ Built deployable applications

**Next Step**: Lecture 10 should focus on **creating custom instruction datasets** - the foundation for building specialized instruction-following models. This builds directly on the fine-tuning knowledge from Lectures 7-8 and prepares students for more advanced customization.

## Learning Objectives for Lecture 10
Based on the progression, Lecture 10 should enable students to:
1. Understand different methods for creating instruction datasets
2. Evaluate dataset creation approaches on multiple dimensions
3. Implement practical dataset creation techniques
4. Understand the relationship between dataset quality and model performance
5. Create datasets suitable for their own specific use cases
