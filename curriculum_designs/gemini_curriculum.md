Expanding the curriculum to include a full journey from pre-training concepts to building agents is how you create a truly comprehensive course.
The key is to structure the journey logically, ensuring each new concept builds on a solid foundation from the previous lectures. We'll use your fantastic human development analogy as the backbone.
Here is a proposed 16-lecture curriculum designed to take your wife from "Zero to Agentic LLM."

### The "0 to LLM" Workshop: A 16-Lecture Curriculum

**Core Philosophy:** Start with a strong mental model (the analogy), provide quick, practical wins, then progressively dive deeper into customization, action, and theory.

---

### **Module 1: Foundations - Meeting the LLM (Lectures 1-4)**

*Goal: To understand what an LLM is, establish a powerful mental model, and achieve the first "magic moment" of using one.*

*   **Lecture 1: What in the World is an LLM?**
    *   **Focus:** Core concepts and terminology.
    *   **Analogy:** "We're going to learn about a new kind of 'computer brain'."
    *   **Key Activities:** Define Prompt, Token, Model, Parameters. Show a simple demo of interacting with a public LLM like Gemini or ChatGPT.
*   **Lecture 2: The Big Picture: A Human Analogy**
    *   **Focus:** Establish the core mental model for the entire course.
    *   **Analogy:** Introduce the **High School Graduate (Pre-training)**, the **PhD Student (Fine-tuning)**, and the **Researcher with a Library Card (RAG)**.
    *   **Key Activities:** Walk through your `lecture-7-notes.md`. This becomes the conceptual anchor for everything that follows.
*   **Lecture 3: The AI Practitioner's Toolkit**
    *   **Focus:** Set up the development environment by explaining the *purpose* of each tool.
    *   **Analogy:** "Every professional needs their tools. We're setting up our workshop."
    *   **Key Activities:**
        *   **Ollama:** "Our local library of pre-trained 'Graduates'." Install it and pull `llama3`.
        *   **Hugging Face:** "The world's biggest 'App Store' for models and datasets."
        *   **Kaggle/Google Colab:** "Our free, powerful cloud computer with GPUs for heavy-duty tasks like fine-tuning."
        *   **WandB:** "Our digital lab notebook for tracking experiments."
*   **Lecture 4: Our First Conversation: Using Pre-trained Models**
    *   **Focus:** The "easy win." Show how to use powerful models with minimal code.
    *   **Analogy:** "Let's talk to one of the 'Graduates' and ask them to do a simple job."
    *   **Key Activities:**
        1.  Use the `ollama` Python library to build a simple chat script. (Your `ollama.ipynb`).
        2.  Use the Hugging Face `pipeline` for sentiment analysis. (Your `sentiment_analysis_with_transformers.ipynb`).

### **Module 2: Customization - Teaching the LLM (Lectures 5-8)**

*Goal: To answer the most common question: "How do I make it work with *my* data?" This module dives deep into RAG and Fine-tuning.*

*   **Lecture 5: The PhD Student: Fine-tuning for a Specific Skill**
    *   **Focus:** Teaching a model a new *behavior* or *style*.
    *   **Analogy:** "The Graduate is going for a PhD to become a specialist."
    *   **Key Activities:** Use the Kaggle Disaster Tweets notebook. Explain that we are **fine-tuning** DistilBERT to become an expert at one task: identifying disaster-related language.
*   **Lecture 6: The Researcher (RAG Part 1): The Language of Meaning (Embeddings)**
    *   **Focus:** The core concept that makes RAG possible.
    *   **Analogy:** "Before building a library, we need a system to organize books by meaning, not just alphabet. This system is called embeddings."
    *   **Key Activities:** Use `sentence-transformers` to show how `king - man + woman` is mathematically close to `queen`. Show how sentences with similar meanings have similar vector representations.
*   **Lecture 7: The Library (RAG Part 2): Building a Vector Database**
    *   **Focus:** Storing and retrieving knowledge efficiently.
    *   **Analogy:** "We have our organization system (embeddings). Now we need to build the actual library shelves to store and find information quickly."
    *   **Key Activities:** Use a simple vector database like ChromaDB or FAISS. Write a script to:
        1.  Take a few `.txt` files as input.
        2.  Generate embeddings for them.
        3.  Store them in the vector database.
        4.  Perform a similarity search to "find the most relevant documents" for a query.
*   **Lecture 8: The Full Researcher: Building Our First RAG System**
    *   **Focus:** Putting the last two lectures together to build a complete RAG pipeline.
    *   **Analogy:** "Let's hire our Researcher. They will take a question, go to the library we built, find the right info, and then answer."
    *   **Key Activities:** Write a script that:
        1.  Takes a user's question.
        2.  Queries the vector database from Lecture 7 to get relevant context.
        3.  Constructs an augmented prompt: `f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"`
        4.  Sends this prompt to the LLM via `ollama` to get a grounded, accurate answer.

### **Module 3: Action - Making the LLM *Do* Things (Lectures 9-12)**

*Goal: To evolve from a knowledge provider to an active participant that can execute tasks.*

*   **Lecture 9: The Graduate with a Calculator: Introduction to Agentic LLMs**
    *   **Focus:** The conceptual leap from generating text to taking actions.
    *   **Analogy:** "What if our Graduate could not only talk, but also use tools like a calculator or a web browser? That's an Agent."
    *   **Key Activities:** Whiteboard the core loop of an agent: **Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Thought...** (ReAct framework).

*   **Lecture 10: The Agent's Toolkit: Introduction to LangChain**
    *   **Focus:** Using a framework to avoid reinventing the wheel.
    *   **Analogy:** "We don't have to build the agent's entire nervous system from scratch. We can use a toolkit like LangChain to connect the 'brain' (LLM) to the 'hands' (Tools)."
    *   **Key Activities:** Explain the main components: LLM Wrappers, Prompt Templates, Output Parsers, and Tools.

*   **Lecture 11: Building a Simple Research Agent**
    *   **Focus:** A practical, hands-on agent build.
    *   **Analogy:** "Let's give our Graduate two tools: a calculator and a web search tool."
    *   **Key Activities:** Use LangChain to build an agent that can access `DuckDuckGoSearch` and a `LLMMathChain`. Show how it intelligently routes "What is the capital of Kenya?" to the search tool and "What is 29*43?" to the math tool.

*   **Lecture 12: Creating Custom Tools for Your Agent**
    *   **Focus:** The true power of agentsâ€”connecting them to any API or function.
    *   **Analogy:** "Now we'll teach our Graduate a custom skill: how to check the weather using a specific weather service."
    *   **Key Activities:** Define a custom LangChain tool from a simple Python function (e.g., `get_current_weather(city: str)`). Give it to the agent and ask it questions about the weather.

### **Module 4: The Deep Dive - Becoming the Architect (Lectures 13-16)**

*Goal: To understand the theory behind the magic and consider the broader implications.*

*   **Lecture 13: The High School Years: A Deeper Look at Pre-training**
    *   **Focus:** Appreciating the scale and architecture of foundation models.
    *   **Analogy:** "We've seen what the Graduate can do. Now let's look at what their 18 years of schooling actually involved."
    *   **Key Activities:** Revisit the LLaMA paper, but now with full context. Explain the concept of the Transformer architecture and Self-Attention at a high level. Emphasize the scale of data and compute.

*   **Lecture 14: Inside the Brain: A Glimpse of PyTorch**
    *   **Focus:** Demystifying the model itself.
    *   **Analogy:** "Let's look at a single 'neuron' or 'brain cell' to see how it works."
    *   **Key Activities:** Walk through your `simple_sentiment_model.py`. Show the `nn.Embedding` and `nn.Linear` layers. Explain how this is a tiny, simplified version of the building blocks used in giant models like Llama 3.

*   **Lecture 15: Is it a Good Brain? Evaluation & Responsible AI**
    *   **Focus:** Critical thinking about LLM performance and ethics.
    *   **Analogy:** "How do we grade our students? Are they fair, honest, and safe?"
    *   **Key Activities:** Discuss hallucination, bias in training data, and the importance of red-teaming. Introduce the concept of benchmarks for evaluation.

*   **Lecture 16: Capstone: Your Personal AI Assistant & The Future**
    *   **Focus:** Tying all the learned concepts together in a final project.
    *   **Analogy:** "Graduation Day."
    *   **Key Activities:** The capstone project: "Build a RAG-based agent that can answer questions about all the Python files and notes from this course." This involves embeddings, a vector DB, an LLM, and an agentic framework. Conclude with a discussion on the future: multi-modal models, on-device AI, and what to learn next.
