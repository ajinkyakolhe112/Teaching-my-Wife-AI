    "# Interacting with LLMs using Hugging Face `transformers`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to load and interact with pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. We will explore two different chat models: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` and `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Installation:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You'll primarily need `transformers` and `torch`.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install transformers torch\n",
    "   # For GPU support, ensure PyTorch is installed with CUDA compatibility.\n",
    "   # For Apple Silicon (MPS), ensure you have a recent PyTorch version.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Model Loading:** Choose a model from the Hugging Face Hub and load it using `AutoModelForCausalLM` and its corresponding tokenizer using `AutoTokenizer`.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Formatting:** Different models require different prompt formats, especially for chat applications. We'll see examples for Llama 2 and TinyLlama.\n",
    "4. **Tokenization:** Convert the formatted prompt into token IDs that the model can understand.\n",
    "5. **Generation:** Use the model's `generate()` method to produce text based on the input tokens. This method has various parameters to control the output (e.g., `max_length`, `temperature`, `top_p`).\n",
    "6. **Decoding:** Convert the generated token IDs back into human-readable text."

    "Llama 2 is a family of pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs released by Meta. The `7b-chat-hf` version is a 7 billion parameter model specifically fine-tuned for dialogue use cases and made available in the Hugging Face `transformers` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Access:** To use Meta's Llama 2 models, you typically need to request access through Meta's official channels and agree to their terms of use. You also need to be authenticated with Hugging Face Hub (`huggingface-cli login`) if you haven't already, and have accepted the model's terms on its Hugging Face page."

    "*   `**inputs`: This unpacks the dictionary returned by the tokenizer (containing `input_ids` and `attention_mask`) as arguments to the `generate` method.\n",

    "*   `do_sample=True`: This flag must be set to `True` to enable sampling-based generation strategies (using `temperature` and `top_p`). If `False`, the model uses greedy decoding (always picks the most probable next token), which can be repetitive."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a hands-on look at interacting with two different open-source chat models using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Library Power:** The `transformers` library simplifies loading models and tokenizers with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "2.  **Model Variety:** Many different models are available on the Hugging Face Hub, each with its own characteristics (size, training data, performance).\n",
    "3.  **Prompt Engineering is Key:** The format of your prompt, including any special tokens or structures (like Llama 2's `[INST]` tags or TinyLlama's role markers), significantly impacts the quality and relevance of the model's response.\n",
    "4.  **Generation Parameters:** Parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` allow you to control the creativity and determinism of the output.\n",
    "5.  **Resource Management:** Using `torch_dtype=torch.float16` and `device_map=\"auto\"` helps in managing memory and utilizing available hardware efficiently, which is especially important for larger models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with different models and prompt engineering techniques is crucial for getting the best results from LLMs."
