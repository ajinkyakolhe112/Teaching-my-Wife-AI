# Week 6: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 1. Introduction to RAG

*   **What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?**
    *   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with external knowledge sources.
    *   It works by first **retrieving** relevant information from a document collection (knowledge base) and then **augmenting** the LLM's input prompt with this retrieved information to **generate** a more informed and contextually relevant response.
    *   Essentially, RAG grounds the LLM's generation on specific, up-to-date, or proprietary information.

*   **Why is RAG Important?**
    RAG addresses several key limitations inherent in standard LLMs:
    *   **Addressing LLM Hallucinations:** LLMs can sometimes "hallucinate" or generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information. RAG mitigates this by providing factual context from external documents, guiding the LLM to generate answers based on verifiable data.
    *   **Overcoming Outdated Knowledge (Knowledge Cutoff):** LLMs are trained on data up to a certain point in time (their "knowledge cutoff"). They are unaware of events or information that occurred after their training. RAG allows LLMs to access and utilize real-time or very recent information by retrieving it from an up-to-date knowledge base.
    *   **Using Custom/Proprietary/Real-time Data:** Businesses and individuals often need LLMs to answer questions or generate content based on their private documents, internal knowledge bases, or rapidly changing data (e.g., product documentation, company policies, latest news feeds). RAG provides a mechanism to use this custom data without the need for expensive and complex fine-tuning of the entire LLM for every new piece of information.
    *   **Providing Citations and Improving Transparency:** Because RAG retrieves specific documents to inform the answer, it can also provide citations or links to these source documents. This increases the transparency and trustworthiness of the LLM's output, allowing users to verify the information.

*   **Core Idea:**
    The fundamental principle of RAG is simple yet powerful:
    1.  **Retrieve:** When a user asks a question, the RAG system first searches a knowledge base (e.g., a collection of documents) for information relevant to the question.
    2.  **Augment:** The retrieved information (e.g., snippets of text from relevant documents) is then added to the user's original question, forming an augmented prompt.
    3.  **Generate:** This augmented prompt is fed to an LLM, which then generates an answer based on both the user's question and the provided contextual information.

    ```
    User Query --> [Retriever] --> Relevant Documents
                      |
                      +--> [LLM] --> Generated Answer
    (Augmented Prompt = User Query + Relevant Documents)
    ```

## 2. Components of a Basic RAG System

A typical RAG system consists of several key components:

*   **A. Document Collection (Knowledge Base):**
    *   **Source of Information:** This is the corpus of data that the RAG system will draw upon. It can include:
        *   Text files (`.txt`, `.md`)
        *   PDFs
        *   Web pages (HTML)
        *   Word documents
        *   Presentations
        *   Databases (e.g., Notion, Confluence content)
        *   Transcripts from videos or audio
    *   **Document Loading and Chunking:**
        *   **Loading:** The first step is to load these documents into the system.
        *   **Chunking:** Large documents are typically broken down into smaller, manageable **chunks** or segments.
        *   **Why Chunking is Important:**
            1.  **Context Window Limits:** LLMs have a finite context window (the maximum number of tokens they can process at once). Feeding an entire large document might exceed this limit.
            2.  **Retrieval Accuracy:** Retrieving smaller, more focused chunks is often more effective than retrieving entire large documents, as it provides more targeted context to the LLM.
            3.  **Efficiency:** Processing and embedding smaller chunks is faster.
        *   **Common Chunking Strategies:**
            *   **Fixed-Size Chunking:** Splitting documents into chunks of a fixed number of characters or tokens, often with some overlap between chunks to maintain context.
            *   **Recursive Chunking:** Recursively splits text based on a list of separators (e.g., paragraphs `\n\n`, then sentences `. `, then words ` `) until chunks are of a desired size. This tries to keep semantically related pieces of text together.
            *   **Semantic Chunking:** (More advanced) Uses NLP techniques (e.g., sentence embeddings) to divide text into chunks that are semantically coherent, rather than just relying on fixed sizes or characters.

*   **B. Embedding Model:**
    *   **Role:** An embedding model converts text (both the document chunks and user queries) into **dense vector representations** (numerical lists or arrays). These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text.
    *   **Process:** Each chunk of text from the knowledge base is passed through the embedding model to generate a vector embedding. Similarly, when a user submits a query, that query is also converted into a vector embedding using the *same* model.
    *   **Importance of Choosing a Good Embedding Model:** The quality of the embeddings is crucial for effective retrieval. A good embedding model will produce similar vectors for texts that have similar meanings.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Sentence Transformers (Open Source):** Models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `msmarco-distilbert-base-v4`, `BAAI/bge-small-en` are popular choices, often providing good performance and running locally.
        *   **OpenAI Embeddings:** Accessible via API (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-3-small`). High quality but involves API calls and costs.
        *   **Cohere Embeddings:** Another API-based option offering multilingual and high-performance embeddings.

*   **C. Vector Database (Vector Store):**
    *   **Role:** A specialized database designed to store, manage, and efficiently search through large quantities of vector embeddings.
    *   **How it Works (Conceptual):**
        1.  **Storage:** The vector embeddings of all document chunks are stored in the vector database. Each vector is often associated with metadata (e.g., the original text chunk, document source, page number).
        2.  **Similarity Search:** When a user query is converted into a query vector, the vector database can quickly find the vectors (and thus, their corresponding document chunks) that are "closest" or most similar to the query vector. This is typically done using algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search for efficiency with large datasets. Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.
    *   **Examples of Vector Databases:**
        *   **In-memory (good for smaller datasets or quick experimentation):**
            *   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Can be run in-memory.
        *   **On-disk / Standalone / Server-based (for larger, persistent, or production systems):**
            *   **ChromaDB:** An open-source embedding database designed to be simple to use. Can run in-memory or persistently.
            *   **Qdrant:** Open-source vector database with advanced filtering and payload features.
            *   **Weaviate:** Open-source, AI-native vector database with graph-like connections.
            *   **Pinecone:** A managed cloud-based vector database service.

*   **D. Retriever:**
    *   **Role:** The component responsible for orchestrating the retrieval process.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Takes the user's raw query string.
        2.  Uses the **embedding model** to convert the query into a vector embedding.
        3.  Queries the **vector database** with this query vector.
        4.  Receives a list of top-K most similar document chunks (along with their text content and any metadata) from the vector database.
        *   "K" is the number of relevant chunks you want to retrieve (e.g., top 3, top 5).

*   **E. LLM (Large Language Model):**
    *   **Role:** The LLM is the component that generates the final human-readable answer.
    *   **Input:** It receives an **augmented prompt** that includes:
        1.  The **original user query**.
        2.  The **retrieved document chunks** (context).
    *   **Process:** The LLM uses its language understanding and generation capabilities to synthesize an answer based *primarily* on the provided context. It should prioritize information from the retrieved chunks over its general pre-trained knowledge if there's a conflict, especially for factual questions.
    *   **Prompting for RAG:** The way you structure the prompt for the LLM is crucial. A common pattern is:

        ```
        Based on the following context, please answer the question. If the context does not contain the answer, say 'I don't have enough information to answer.'

        Context:
        ---
        [Retrieved Document Chunk 1 Text]
        ---
        [Retrieved Document Chunk 2 Text]
        ---
        ... (other chunks) ...
        ---

        Question: [Original User Query]

        Answer:
        ```

## 3. Basic RAG Pipeline Workflow (Step-by-Step)

The RAG process can be divided into two main pipelines:

*   **A. Indexing Pipeline (Offline / Preprocessing):**
    This pipeline is run once (or periodically when the knowledge base updates) to prepare the documents.
    1.  **Load Documents:** Read documents from various sources (files, URLs, databases).
    2.  **Chunk Documents:** Split the loaded documents into smaller, manageable chunks.
    3.  **Embed Chunks:** Use an embedding model to convert each text chunk into a vector embedding.
    4.  **Store Embedded Chunks:** Store these embeddings (and their corresponding text/metadata) in a vector database. This creates an "index" that can be efficiently searched.

    ```
    [Docs] -> Load -> Chunk -> Embed -> [Vector DB Index]
    ```

*   **B. Querying / Inference Pipeline (Online / Real-time):**
    This pipeline runs every time a user submits a query.
    1.  **User Submits Query:** The user provides an input question or prompt.
    2.  **Embed User Query:** The same embedding model used during indexing converts the user's query into a vector embedding.
    3.  **Search Vector Database:** The retriever uses this query vector to search the vector database and retrieve the top-K most relevant/similar document chunks.
    4.  **Construct Augmented Prompt:** The retrieved document chunks are combined with the original user query to form a comprehensive prompt for the LLM.
    5.  **LLM Generates Answer:** The LLM processes the augmented prompt and generates an answer based on the provided context and the query.

    ```
    User Query -> Embed Query -> Search Vector DB -> [Retrieved Chunks]
                                                           |
                                                           + -> Construct Prompt -> [LLM] -> Answer
    ```

## 4. Simple RAG Example (Conceptual)

Let's imagine a tiny knowledge base about fruits:

*   **Document 1 (apple.txt):** "Apples are round fruits that grow on trees. They can be red, green, or yellow. Apples are crunchy and often sweet."
*   **Document 2 (banana.txt):** "Bananas are long, curved fruits with a yellow peel when ripe. They are soft and sweet. Bananas grow in bunches."
*   **Document 3 (orange.txt):** "Oranges are citrus fruits known for their orange color and high vitamin C content. They have a tough peel and juicy flesh."

**Indexing Pipeline (Conceptual Steps):**
1.  **Load:** Load `apple.txt`, `banana.txt`, `orange.txt`.
2.  **Chunk:** (Assume each document is small enough to be a single chunk for this example).
    *   Chunk 1: "Apples are round fruits..."
    *   Chunk 2: "Bananas are long, curved fruits..."
    *   Chunk 3: "Oranges are citrus fruits..."
3.  **Embed:** Convert each chunk into a vector embedding using a sentence transformer.
    *   `vector_apple_chunk = embed("Apples are round fruits...")`
    *   `vector_banana_chunk = embed("Bananas are long, curved fruits...")`
    *   `vector_orange_chunk = embed("Oranges are citrus fruits...")`
4.  **Store:** Store these vectors in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or ChromaDB) linked to their original text.

**Querying/Inference Pipeline:**

*   **User Query:** "What color are apples?"
*   **Embed Query:** `query_vector = embed("What color are apples?")`
*   **Search Vector DB:** The retriever searches the vector DB with `query_vector`. The `vector_apple_chunk` will likely be the most similar.
    *   **Retrieved Chunk:** "Apples are round fruits that grow on trees. They can be red, green, or yellow. Apples are crunchy and often sweet."
*   **Construct Augmented Prompt for LLM:**
    ```
    Based on the following context, please answer the question.

    Context:
    ---
    Apples are round fruits that grow on trees. They can be red, green, or yellow. Apples are crunchy and often sweet.
    ---

    Question: What color are apples?

    Answer:
    ```
*   **LLM Generates Answer:** "Based on the context, apples can be red, green, or yellow."

**Popular Libraries Simplifying RAG:**

Implementing all these components from scratch can be complex. Libraries like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** provide high-level abstractions and tools to build RAG pipelines more easily. They offer:
*   Document loaders for various formats.
*   Multiple chunking strategies.
*   Integrations with many embedding models and vector databases.
*   Pre-built "chains" or "indexes" for RAG.
*   Helper utilities for prompt construction.

These libraries are highly recommended for building practical RAG applications.

## 5. Advantages of RAG

*   **Improved Accuracy and Factual Consistency:** By grounding responses in retrieved evidence, RAG significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the factual accuracy of LLM outputs.
*   **Ability to Use Up-to-Date or Custom Information:** Allows LLMs to leverage information that was not part of their original training data, including real-time data or proprietary knowledge.
*   **Transparency and Verifiability:** RAG systems can often cite the sources of information used to generate an answer, allowing users to verify the facts and build trust.
*   **Reduces Need for Extensive Fine-tuning:** For knowledge-intensive tasks, RAG can be a more efficient alternative to fine-tuning an LLM on new documents, especially when the knowledge base changes frequently.
*   **Cost-Effective for Dynamic Knowledge:** Updating a vector database with new information is generally cheaper and faster than retraining or fine-tuning an LLM.
*   **Enhanced Control:** Developers can control the information sources and update them as needed.

## 6. Limitations and Considerations

*   **Quality of Retrieval is Crucial ("Garbage In, Garbage Out"):**
    *   If the retriever fetches irrelevant or low-quality documents, the LLM will likely produce irrelevant or poor-quality answers, even if the LLM itself is very capable.
    *   The effectiveness of the entire RAG system hinges on the retriever's ability to find the *right* context.
*   **Choosing the Right Chunking Strategy:**
    *   Poor chunking can lead to fragmented context or missed information. The optimal chunk size and strategy can depend on the data and the LLM.
*   **Embedding Model Selection:**
    *   The choice of embedding model impacts retrieval quality. Some models are better for specific types of text or tasks.
*   **Context Window Limitations of the LLM:**
    *   The amount of retrieved context that can be fed to the LLM is limited by its context window. If too many chunks are retrieved, or chunks are too large, they might need to be truncated or summarized, potentially losing information.
*   **Complexity of the System:**
    *   RAG systems have more moving parts (document processors, embedders, vector store, retriever, LLM) than direct LLM prompting, increasing development and maintenance complexity.
*   **Cost:**
    *   If using API-based services for embedding models (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) or the LLM itself, costs can accumulate based on usage.
*   **Latency:**
    *   The retrieval step adds latency to the overall response time compared to directly querying an LLM. Optimizing the retrieval process is important for real-time applications.
*   **Evaluation Challenges:** Evaluating RAG systems can be complex, requiring assessment of both retrieval quality and generation quality.

## 7. Conclusion
